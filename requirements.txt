1. The database shall store cold case data.
2. The system shall allow the admin to insert and delete data from the database.
3. The system shall compare cold case data with new dna samples.
4. The system shall assign a number value to each dna sample.
5. The website shall represent data from the database with graphs.

I like these requirements, I just wanna talked about requirement 4. I don't know if we'd be able
to make the system be automated to assign a value to each dna sample. My thoughts were that the "DNA" would
just be some random number we come up with just to show it comparing data.
