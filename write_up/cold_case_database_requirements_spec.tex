\title{ESOF 322: Project 1 - Cold Case Database}
\author{Jacob Coleman, William Jardee, Fletcher Philips, Megan Steinmasel}
\maketitle


%%TO-DO


\textbf{System Description}: In the world of criminal justice, it is not a rare occurrence that the truth is thinly veiled by a lack of gathered evidence or proper techniques to analyze current data. A prime example of this is the aid of DNA testing in prosecution. The proposed software system will collect old and new evidence into one database (a centralized storage system), organize it, and present it to domain specialists through an easy-to-use website. The initial construction of this project is humble but aims to create a skeleton for more sophisticated analysis techniques to be built on. It is assumed that there are two primary ways to interact with the system: through control of the database operations and in the form of the website; these are the database engineer and website user, respectively.\vspace{1.5em}

\textit{Database Engineer}: An individual knowledgeable of how the system works and responsible for maintenance and updates.\vspace{0.5em}

\textit{Website  User}: A front-end user that likely lacks data science knowledge traversing the web system.\vspace{0.5em}

\textit{Criminal Justice Professional}: Someone in the field of criminal justice who will be using our system to make their job easier (This is synonymous with Website User).\vspace{0.5em}

\vspace{1em}


\section*{User Stories}

\noindent\textbf{Epic}: As a Criminal Justice Professional, I want a database that can hold, sort, and present data according to a variety of different queries and eventually use state-of-the-art algorithms to help me succeed in my job.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textbf{\hypertarget{us1}{User Story 1}} (Megan Steinmasel):  As a website User, I want a search bar that will search the database.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textbf{\hypertarget{us2}{User Story 2}} (William Jardee): As a website user, I need the processing of data to be done automatically in a way that is friendly to someone that is not a data scientist.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textbf{\hypertarget{us3}{User Story 3}} (Jacob Coleman): As a website user, I want a data visualization technique that is intuitive and accurately shows patterns in the data.\vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textbf{\hypertarget{us4}{User Story 4}} (Fletcher Philips): As a database engineer, I want to have a central storage system so that I can store cold cases inside of it. \vspace{0.5em}

\noindent\textbf{\hypertarget{us5}{User Story 5}} (Fletcher Philips): As a database engineer, I want a central storage system so that the admin can insert and delete data.\vspace{0.5em}
